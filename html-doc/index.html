      <h1>General Algo Discussion</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">We compute measure and contour using stripes.The stripes used for measure and contour problems differ slightly.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">For measure problem:
We store the sum of lengths of x intervals that contribute to measure in that stripe.
Multiplying this x measure with the width of y interval of stripe gives measure.
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">For contour problem:
For solving this it is enough to find horizontal pieces of contour. To find the horizontal pieces, we check for each horizontal edge of the rectangle to find out the parts which have a rectangle area only on one side of the edge. These parts contribute to the horizontal contour pieces.
Now, we join the horizontal lines with lines only parallel to the Y-axis starting from the bottom most one. (they uniquely determine vertical pieces)

So, to solve the measure and contour problem we need to compute stripes.
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey"><ul>Algorithm for computing stripes:
<li>We work on the set of vertical edges of rectangles sorted based on their y coordinate.</li>
<li>It is a divide and conquer algorithm.</li>
<li>Divide: Divide the set of vertical edges into left and right set (roughly equal frequency on both sides) recursively till youâ€™ve only one edge</li>
<li>Merge(conquer):</li>
<li>This part has 3 main sub routines</li>
<li>Copy:Expand y intervals from left to right and vice versa</li>
<li>Blacken:Extends x union interval based on partner less edges</li>
<li>Concat:Concatenates left and right sides</li>
</ul>

      <h1>Implementation Details</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">Although the crux of this algorithm is finding the Stripes. Achieving n logn complexity would not have been possible if the other utility functions were implemented in O(n^2).<br>
Here, we have built the data structures L and R such that the edges are present in a sorted order. The L and R start with one edge each in the base case of the Stripes algorithm, and in the merge step, they get combined with the L and R of other frames. Here we have exploited the singleton property of these data structures and designed our findUnion, findIntersect and findDifference such that they maintain the sorted property of the L and R. This also helps reduce the complexity of blacken and concat functions while merging the stripes.

      <h1>Issues faced while coding</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">The paper talked about implementing a few Data Structures and methods, which were relevant only at an abstract level and not directly useful when it came to implementation level. This has caused a lot of confusion as we were unsure of what classes to code.
Ex: Union(R) = this said it included all rectangles and it is impossible to even implement this. Because we cannot put all the points inside a rectangle in a data structure(as it is would be infinite). And it is not clearly mentioned whether it has just the corner points or just the boundary points. This was a bottleneck when we were trying to understand and implement the paper.
</h5>
<h5 class="w3-padding-16">Complexity :  There were a lot of utility functions that were necessary to implement the main algorithm. For these functions the implementation level details were not mentioned in the paper, even the data structure used was unclear. These played an important role in reducing the complexity. They were the bottleneck to achieve at the O(nlogn) complexity. 
Ex: Set Operations - to compute the L,R and LR. It was necessary to find union, intersection and difference of sets. Which the author did not mention any internal details about. This has caused a huge trouble in the implementation.
A normal approach to do this took O(n^2). 
The major functions Blacken and concat were also not explained properly. Any small difference in the implementation would have led to O(n^3) implementation of Concat function and O(n^2) implementation of Blacken function. It took us days to figure out a method which can align the Y-intervals so that the set operations and the copy, blacken and concat to O(n) complexity.


There were a lot of functions which were used in the Abstract Explanation of the Algorithm. But were not even used in the implementation. This caused a lot of confusion and it felt like the abstraction and the implementation are totally different. 
Ex: Union(R), Intervals()

</h5>
<h5 class="w3-padding-16">
And a lot of cases were not covered in computation of the contour. After computing the stripes, when we need to find contour from the given horizontal edges and types, it is not very intuitive to figure out how to use the tree implementation of the x_union of the stripes and compute the contour pieces. The paper only covers one aspect of it.

We had used in built library function - STL sort. This was unable to handle larger testcases and for the same, we implemented the sorting algorithms from scratch as well.
